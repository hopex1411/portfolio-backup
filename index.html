				alt="a short gif showing some of the photos i have taken" class="col4 squareimage" rel="noopener">
			<p class="marginleft"><span class="pink">Discord BOT aka. Jørgke:</span> My newest project was creating a
				Discord BOT that would combine multiple BOT's features into a single BOT, while keeping all the old features and
				being able to easily add new. It was setup in DigitalOcean on a Fedora server & I used RedBOT, DiscordJS
				& Discord.py for this project. I could have chosen to make it fully manually using nodeJS, but that
				would be too big of a task for a single person.</p>
			<ul>
				<p>The main goals was to have:</p>
				<li><b>Auto-mod:</b> The BOT can recognize bad behaviour and take action against people breaking the rules, without the need of an actual
					person.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Temporary-Voicechannels:</b> If someone didn't want to communicate in a public
					voicechat, they automatically get a private-voicechat they "own" until they leave it, and then the
					voicechat automaticlly gets deleted.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Logs over activity:</b> The bot will create an embedded message in a
					private channel for the serverowner, where it shows if someone gets muted, banned, kicked,
					message deleted, and other statitics</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Music Player:</b> With a single command, the BOT can join a voicechannel and play music with a
					link the use provide</span></li>
			</ul><br>
			<p>I combined the names of a few previous bots, Jørgen + Rikke & got the name Jørgke.</p>
