			<p class="marginleft">Hi. <span class="pink">My name is Ada Ulrik</span>, I am 19 years old and graduated the Webintegrator
				education in the fall of 2019. I have worked in IT, and have past experience from both working in-store and in a customer service department.
				<br>
				Right now, most of my skills are related to web development. I am very
				familiar in JavaScript, HTML, CSS and mySQL. I have worked alot with the adobe package, especially
				Photoshop and Premiere Pro. I am always ready to learn any useful skills depending on the job. Having
				experience in coding, design and planning, I can easily pick up any related skill.</p>

				programmer from Poland, a programmer from Denmark, and a writer from Italy. I was put in charge of all the
				designs, which i never have done before, so I learned a new skill while working under "crunch". My game can
