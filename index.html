			<p class="marginleft">Hi. <span class="pink">My name is Ada Ulrik</span>, I'm a 19 year old graduated
				Webintegrator.
				I have worked in IT, and have past experience from both working in-store, office and in a customer
				service department.
				<br>
				Right now, most of my skills are related to web development, bot development and helpdesk-support. I am
				very
				familiar in JavaScript, HTML, CSS and mySQL. I have worked alot with the adobe package, especially
				Photoshop and Premiere Pro. I am always ready to learn any useful skills depending on the job. Having
				experience in coding, design and planning, I can easily pick up any related skill.

					I often work with Danish streamers on the twitch.tv platform. For example, Last December I finished
					a
					Christmas project with Melina/MinnaMumi, where I created an online advent calendar that she opened
					with her viewers every day. Every month, I edit a video for a twitch-streamer, and recently I built

					DiscordJS & Discord.py

				The goal was to create a game from stratch in under 48 hours and make new friends. I got to work with a
				programmer from Poland, a programmer from Denmark, and a writer from Italy. I was put in charge of all
				the
				designs, which i never have done before, so I learned a new skill while working under "crunch". My game

			<p class="marginleft"><span class="pink">Discord BOT aka. Jørgke:</span> My newest project was creating a
				Discord BOT that would combine multiple BOT's features into a single BOT, while keeping all the old features and
				being able to easily add new. It was setup in DigitalOcean on a Fedora server & I used RedBOT, DiscordJS
				& Discord.py for this project. I could have chosen to make it fully manually using nodeJS, but that
				would be too big of a task for a single person.</p>
			<ul>
				<p>The main goals was to have:</p>
				<li><b>Auto-mod:</b> The BOT can recognize bad behaviour and taking action against people breaking the rules, without the need of an actual
					person.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Temporary-Voicechannels:</b> If someone didn't want to communicate in a public
					voicechat, they automatically get a private-voicechat they "own" until they leave it, and then the
					voicechat automaticlly deleted.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Logs over activity:</b> The bot will create an embedded message in a
					private channel for the serverowner, where it shows if someone gets muted, banned, kicked,
					message deleted, and other statitics</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Music Player:</b> With a single command, the BOT can join a voicechannel and play music with a
					link the use provide</span></li>
			</ul><br>
			<p>I combined the names of a few previous bots, Jørgen + Rikke & got an AI
				to create a face, which is a mix of all sex and races.</p>
